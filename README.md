# 2048NN
### Train a neural network to play 2048

Numerous AI algorithms have been delevoped to play the game of "2048".
This project seeks to implement an algorithm inspired by AlphaZero, namely:
- dual policy & value networks
- monte carlo tree search
- no or minimal playing heuristics
- reinforcement learning through self-play
